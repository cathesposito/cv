    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a passionate teacher with three years of experience in mechanical technician courses.
        As a research assistant, I was very detail-oriented with hands-on experience performing laboratory work for four years,
        having high proficiency in conducting comprehensive literature reviews and preparing samples and specimens for materials non-destructive testing.
